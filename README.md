Current Stable Version: 
Current Build Version:1.0.0_3

Modbus_rw is an application that runs on the Maestro RTU. The application gathers modbus data and ignition, power information and packages this data which is then send to the ROAM application


Functionality 
1) Sends Power UP message - When the device/application restarts on sensing power input
2) Sends Power Loss message - When the device senses loss of power input
3) Sends Power Restore message - When the device senses power input
4) Sends Periodic Modbus data - Send at a regular interval when ignition is ON
5) Sends a Heartbeat - Send at a regualar interval 
6) Sends a response to Poll - Send as a response to a command receieved from platform
7) Sends Ignition Off - Send when ignition power goes from high to low for 5 seconds
8) Sends Ignition Off - Send when ignition power goes to low from high for 5 seconds
9) Update the server configuration OTA
10) Update the reporting rate configuration OTA
11) Restarts Applicatiion weekly
12) Sends the fault and the associated value of the fault
13) Sends a ping to keep the tcp connection alive
