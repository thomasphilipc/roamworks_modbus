# Maestro Modbus
Version

Modbus_rw is an application that runs on the Maestro RTU. The application gathers modbus data and ignition, power information and packages this data which is then send to the ROAM application


Functionality 
1) Sends Power UP message - When the device/application restarts on sensing power input
2) Sends Power Loss message - When the device senses loss of power input
3) Sends Power Restore message - When the device senses power input
4) Sends Periodic Modbus data - Send at a regular interval when ignition is ON
5) Sends a Heartbeat - Send at a regualar interval 
6) Sends a response to Poll - Send as a response to a command receieved from platform
7) Sends Ignition Off - Send when ignition power goes from high to low for 5 seconds
8) Sends Ignition Off - Send when ignition power goes to low from high for 5 seconds

Application Logic 

A primary recurring 1 second alarm/timer is run to monitor change in states and to keep a track of time. During each cycle the system flags a control to execute the required operation

There are some auxillary timers/alarms that control the reading from tcp line at every 30 seconds and monitor IO lines for changes every second


Task to do

Delete database periodically to control usage 
    ? When to delete - after every week 
Controlled restart of the application every week 

Known Issues/ Limitations

If a TCP connection is lost, the device will attempt to reconnect tcp and has no managed method of trying
The device does not maintain its previous states on power loss
If Internet is not available there is no fallback

Future Enhancements

Change Reporting Rate and Heartbeat interval OTA
Save states on device in case or restart
Add SMS Fallback
Build and Engineering interface
Log information and make this available
Monitor App crash 
Forward modbus writing using Modbus TCP
